- This project is currently **frontend-only** and runs entirely on the client side.
- No backend or database is connected at this stage.
- Application data may reset on page refresh due to the lack of persistent storage.
- Several components and custom hooks are still **experimental** and may be refactored.
- File and folder structure may change as new features are introduced.
- Styling and UI/UX are functional but not final.
- Error handling and edge cases are still being improved.
- The project is under active development and should be considered a **work in progress**.
